                <p>Hello, my name is William Scott, and I learned that I could make a free website using my GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages">React GitHub Pages</a>), so I did. I love programming and have been pursuing a career in front-end development for the better part of three years, letting serendipity guide me from opportunity to opportunity. This website is mostly just another way for me to share my resume, but I am also planning on using it for random React projects that I find amusing. I am a team player who makes sure that projects are clear before they begin, am never afraid to ask an ignorant question, and avidly pursue games of all genres, whether that is a complex board game or the latest AAA title.</p>
